Last time, I'm used the HEXO to build a blog. (before 2018 I used wordpress for [my old blog site](https://web.archive.org/web/20180105093233/https://linux.dog/) ...  ) At that time, Im a ~~full-stack developer~~ (not real just node.js user). We love everthing on node.js runtime, npm, and other things. That's easy way to use the `yarn` get everything.
I've been following the trendy stuff, ignore actually write sth. I hope my blog able to really build up some knowledge for me.

I thought HEXO had been good until I started working for [meta.io (2021-2022)](https://github.com/Meta-Network). They chose to use HEXO as a static site generator to generate sites from their "User centre", which was done to make static resources (deploy on chain) work better on Web3.

> I should clarify that Im just interested in web3 technology. Thats really an "out-of-the-box" resource provable system (I'm bullshitting, u must have a lot of objections).

The process of developing the HEXO plugin has led me to read a lot of source code, plugins, and most of them have not been maintained for a long time. It's hard to be timeless after being fashionable. Thats worries me, even though my blog is same not update ...

By chance I started using [logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq) as my knowledge tool. After that I heard about [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and I started to experiment with it as a markdown tool. They r [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) firendly and can export the doc to HTML for a site. **So why not use those build my blog ?** 

## 🔍 Some research
We can found some HTML converter and generator tools search by Google. We need the publisher convert the Obsidian markdown document to HTML pages, and generate a site for publish. After sifting through them, I found publish solutions via jekyll or hugo, in addition to the official website generation service.
- Jekyll: https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template
- Hugo: https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz
So, I have created a "workflow" for note/blog posting. I opted for the hugo solution ... Changes were made to his [Github repo](https://github.com/u-u-z/back-yard-site) to create this site. The site content its in [another repo](https://github.com/u-u-z/back-yard-content). I make changes to my notes (things I want to publish) directly in Obsidian, and committing the commit triggers Github actions to package my site and update it to the Cloudflare pages service. (Despite being trolled by [friend🍋](https://lemonhx.moe) for being too slow to update 😂)
